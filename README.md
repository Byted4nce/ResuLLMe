## üöÄ Concept

ResuLLMe is a prototype that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to tailor resumes. Its goal is to enhance resumes to help candidates avoid commonplace mistakes that happen when applying to job posts. It is like a smart career advisor to check your resume.

You can use ResuLLMe live at [https://resullme.streamlit.app/](https://resullme.streamlit.app/).

## üõ† How It Works

ResuLLMe receives your previous CV as a PDF or Word Document. Then, it uses LLMs to:
* Improve the resume following published resume guidelines by well-reputed schools
* Convert the resume to a JSON Resume format
* Render the JSON resume using LaTeX to generate a new PDF of the enhanced resume

## üèÉ Running

To run ResuLLMe locally, execute:

```
streamlit run src/Main.py
```

Notice that you will need to install the dependencies in `requirements.txt` for your code to work, and install the packages in `packages.txt` for the LaTeX rendering to work (or equivalent if not using Ubuntu).

## ü§≤ Contributing

ResuLLMe is an open source project.

If you want to contribute, open a [Pull requests](https://github.com/360macky/project-name/pulls). 
All contributions are welcome, but some that would particularly be useful to the community are:
* Fixes in existing LaTeX templates
* Adding new LaTeX templates
* Improved prompts
* Support for other LLMs (e.g. Bard, Claude, LLaMA)
