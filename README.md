## üöÄ Concept

ResuLLMe is a prototype that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to tailor r√©sum√©s. It's goal is to enhance r√©sum√©s to help candidates avoid common mistakes that occur while applying for jobs. It is like a smart career advisor to check your r√©sum√©.

You can use ResuLLMe live at [https://resullme.streamlit.app/](https://resullme.streamlit.app/).

## üõ† How It Works

ResuLLMe receives your previous CV as a PDF or Word Document. Then, it uses LLMs to:
* Improve the r√©sum√© following published r√©sum√© guidelines by well-reputed schools
* Convert the r√©sum√©s to a JSON Resume format
* Render the JSON resume using LaTeX to generate a new PDF of the enhanced resume

## üèÉ Running

To run ResuLLMe locally, execute:

```
streamlit run src/Main.py
```

Notice that you will need to install the dependencies in `requirements.txt` for your code to work, and install the packages in `packages.txt` for the LaTeX rendering to work (or equivalent if not using Ubuntu).

#INSTALLATION

$ sudo apt-get install package-name

## ü§≤ Contributing

ResuLLMe is an open source project.

If you want to contribute, open a [Pull requests](https://github.com/360macky/project-name/pulls). 
All contributions are welcome, but some that would particularly be useful to the community are:
* Fixes in existing LaTeX templates
* Adding new LaTeX templates
* Improved prompts
* Support for other LLMs (e.g. Bard, Claude, LLaMA)
