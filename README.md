# ResuLLMe [![Open in Streamlit](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://resullme.streamlit.app/)

This is an experimental resume generator using Large Language Models (LLMs).

To run it, execute:

```
streamlit run src/Main.py
```

Currently, the resume generation is working. Based on your previous resume, we can generate a LaTeX resume and a JSON resume.
